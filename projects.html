                    <p>The Tamagotchi project was the first solo project I completed during my time taking General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp. This project was created over a week and included the use of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation. It is similar to the classic Tamagotchi game as you can feed your pet, play with your pet, and put your pet to sleep using on-screen buttons that decrement your pet's stats by 1 with each click. Your pet ages over time and, if the timer runs out or one of the stats reaches 10, your pet dies. Animation on screen shows your pet evolving over time and, in the end, passing away. I intentionally used a cheery and inviting color palette as this classic game was very nostalgic and wholesome for me and I wanted to reflect that feeling in the aesthetic.</p>

                    <p>Pets4U was my second project during my time with General Assembly and my first partner-project. This project was created over a week and included the use of HTML5, EJS, CSS3, JavaScript, DOM manipulation, MongoDB, Mongoose, Nodemailer, and Multer. This mock-page was created to display an animal rescue group. You can view animals available for adoption and specify by location. When you select an animal, the site redirects you to that animal's show page where you can opt to "adopt" that pet where you will be asked to enter your name and e-mail. Once this is completed, an e-mail is sent to the entered e-mail congratulating you on your request for adoption. There is an option to register with the site which gives you "admin privileges" so you may add a pet, edit a pet, or delete a pet. This project was a big undertaking given the class progress up to that point and working with my incredibly-talented partner was a fantastic experience. </p>

                    <p>This project was a collaboration project between the Software Engineering and UX/UI Design immersive courses at General Assembly. Teams were randomly assigned a mix of UX/UI and Software Engineering students. A random prompt was given with the parameters being the application had to have a landing page, an option to "sign up" for the site (add inputted data to the database), a page to view information of "users" who have "signed up", be accessible, and be mobile-friendly. This project was created in less than 24 hours with a team of two designers and three engineers. My team went above and beyond the prompt creating an entire semi-functioning site. User info can be viewed and text verification was initiated. This project was another huge undertaking given the time constraints and I am so proud of my team for what we were able to achieve in such a short time-period.</p>

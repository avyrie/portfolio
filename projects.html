                            <p>The Tamagotchi project was the first solo project I completed during my time taking General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp. This project was created over a week and included the use of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation. It is similar to the classic Tamagotchi game as you can feed your pet, play with your pet, and put your pet to sleep using on-screen buttons that decrement your pet's stats by 1 with each click. Your pet ages over time and, if the timer runs out or one of the stats reaches 10, your pet dies. Animation on screen shows your pet evolving over time and, in the end, passing away. I intentionally used a cheery and inviting color palette as this classic game was very nostalgic and wholesome for me and I wanted to reflect that feeling in the aesthetic.</p>

                            <p>Pets4U was my second project during my time with General Assembly and my first partner-project. This project was created over a week and included the use of HTML5, EJS, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, DOM manipulation, MongoDB, Mongoose, Nodemailer, and Multer. This mock-page was created to display an animal rescue group. You can view animals available for adoption and specify by location. When you select an animal, the site redirects you to that animal's show page where you can opt to "adopt" that pet where you will be asked to enter your name and e-mail. Once this is completed, an e-mail is sent to the entered e-mail congratulating you on your request for adoption. There is an option to register with the site which gives you "admin privileges" so you may add a pet, edit a pet, or delete a pet. This project was a big undertaking given the class progress up to that point and working with my incredibly-talented partner was a fantastic experience. </p>

                            <p>This project was a collaboration project between the Software Engineering and UX/UI Design immersive courses at General Assembly. Teams were randomly assigned a mix of UX/UI and Software Engineering students. A random prompt was given with the parameters being the application had to have a landing page, an option to "sign up" for the site (add inputted data to the database), a page to view information of "users" who have "signed up", be accessible, and be mobile-friendly. This project was created in less than 24 hours with a team of two designers and three engineers. My team went above and beyond the prompt creating an entire semi-functioning site. User info can be viewed and text verification was initiated. This project was another huge undertaking given the time constraints and I am so proud of my team for what we were able to achieve in such a short time-period.</p>

                            <p>Wayfarer was my second group project with General Assembly. Working with two other randomly-assigned software engineers, we were given a client and existing wireframes/user stories for a prospective travel app where users can leave reviews for a handful of pre-selected cities. We had multiple clarification meetings with this client to ensure they would be completely satisfied with the finished product. We created this project over the course of four week days using Django, Python, Pillow, Paperclip, Bulma, CSS3, HTML5, Javascript and was deployed using Heroku. This project was the most challenging assignment during my time thus far with General Assembly as it involved many different and specific requirements that were expected to be copleted over a short time-frame. However, my group was populated with talented and driven individuals and we produced a complete and extremely functional app.</p>

                            <p>TrailStamp was my final project with General Assembly and my first solo full-stack project. This MERN stack application was created over the course of a week using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and React.js. The purpsoe of this project was to provide a "stamp card" application where users could add hikes that they have either been on or would like to go on and provide an option for them to rate and review the hike once they have completed it. This application was created with full CRUD abilities.</p>

                            <p>tweet2020 is the result of General Assembly's 2020 alumni hackathon. Each person was placed into one of five teams made up of software developers and user experience designers. The prompt of this hackathon was Election 2020 with an emphasis on bipartisanship. My team chose to focus on a project that would help engage younger and possible unregistered voters and encourage them to register to vote if they have not already done so. tweet2020 is a quiz app that shows the user a tweet from an unidentifiable source and prompts them to select a guess as to which 2020 presidential candidate tweeted it. At the end of the quiz, the user has the option to tweet their score and each page has a button which, when clicked, will redirect the user to vote.org's page to check your registration status. This project was created and completed over the course of three days with the collaboration of three software developers and four UX designers using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, and was deployed with netlify.</p>

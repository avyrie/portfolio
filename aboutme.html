            <p>Hello! My name is Ally and I am a Software Engineer. When I was furloughed from my job in Inventory Management due to Covid-19, I knew I had to find a way to keep moving forward instead of just sitting around waiting for things to improve enough for me to go back to work.</p>

                <p>I stumbled across an ad for a free intro to HTML and CSS mini course through General Assembly and signed up for an immersive Software Engineering bootcamp immediately after completing the intro course. It has been a whirlwind since then, but I have enjoyed every second of it!</p>

            <p>I have been working professionally since the age of 13. My past work experience has mostly included customer service, administration assistance, social media control, data entry, and animal care. Post-high school, I was accepted into and attended Coastal Carolina University for Marine Science and later transferred to George Mason University where I went on to achieve my BS in Biology.</p>

                <p>When I am not coding, you can find me hiking, playing video games, or hanging out with one (or sometimes all) of my pets. My current menagerie includes two ball pythons and one kitty. In the past, my menagerie has included a zebra finch, a ferret, a spiny mantid, an orchid mantid, a chinchilla, multitudes of tropical freshwater fish, and a crested gecko.</p>

            <p>Bartholemoux is my pastel ball python. I have had him since he was just a few months old and he is now 4 years old as of 2020! I love attending pet and reptile expos and Bartholemous is my go-to expo buddy! He is wonderful to display for educational purposes as he is very calm and gentle. He is a snake ambassador helping to decrease the negative stigmas surrounding snakes!</p>
